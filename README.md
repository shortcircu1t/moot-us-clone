Right now you can only:

- Sign up and log in
- Edit your profile
- Create, filter and delete posts
- Search for other users

To run the project locally you will have to set up a project in MongoDB Atlas with posts and users collections and provide the mongoURI key as well as jsonwebtoken secret string in keys.dev.js file.
